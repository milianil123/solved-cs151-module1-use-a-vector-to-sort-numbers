# Module 1: Course Introduction

## Project 1 – Use a vector to sort numbers

The purpose of this project is to generate thirty random whole numbers between 1 and 10, insert them into a vector in *descending* order, then and print the numbers in *ascendin*g order:

Use the following plan of attack:

1. Create an empty vector of **int** elements.2. Use the **srand** function to change the “seed” for generating random numbers so that the **rand** function will generate a *different* set of random numbers every time your program is run.3. Use the **rand** function to generate a random number whole number between 0 and **RAND_MAX** (using Dev-C++, **RAND_MAX** is 32,767).4. Convert this number into a number between 1 and 10.– *hint:* use the **%** operator.5. Use a loop to **scan** the vector until you find the position of an element containing a number that is less than the random number just generated above.6. Use an iterator to *insert* the random number into the vector at that position.7. Go back to step 3 and perform again until the vector contains 30 random numbers8. After all 30 numbers have been generated and inserted into the vector, they should appear in *descending* order in the vector.9. Use the **pop_back** function in a loop to print the numbers in *ascending* order on the console until the vector is empty.

## Project 2 – Use a vector to sort countries by area

Below is a list of the 14 countries in South America, including their population and area:

| Name | Population (in 1,000’s) | Area (sq. miles) || :————–: | :———————: | :————–: || Argentina | 45,258 | 1,073,234 || Bolivia | 11,696 | 424,052 || Brazil | 212,845 | 3,287,086 || Chile | 19,206 | 291,855 || Columbia | 51,115 | 440,715 || Ecuador | 17,705 | 106,851 || Falkland Islands | 3 | 4,700 || French Guiana | 290 | 32,253 || Guyana | 787 | 82,978 || Paraguay | 7,145 | 157,056 || Peru | 33,108 | 496,093 || Suriname | 586 | 63,252 || Uruguay | 3,475 | 68,037 || Venezuela | 28,102 | 353,748 |




Create a class called **Country**.

– The properties (variables) of each country will be its name, population, and area.– Put the definitions of those properties and prototypes of functions in a header file with a guard.– Put the function definitions in a .cpp file.– Functions should include a constructor and “getters” for each property of the class.

Then, similar to what you did in project 1:

1. Create an empty vector of **Country** elements (make this a global variable).2. In main, in alphabetic order, create a **Country** object for each of the countries in South America.– as each is created insert it into the vector in *ascending* order based on the country’s area.– consider writing a function which takes a **Country** object and inserts it into the vector in the appropriate spot in the vector.3. Once the vector is filled, print a report showing each country.– At the top of the report, put headings at the top of each column.– Do *not* use **pop_back**. Instead, simply use a loop to access and print the values of each country in the vector, starting with element #0.4. Inside the loop, use the **cout** object to align columns:– The name of the country should be left-aligned (padded to the right)– The population and area should be right-aligned (padded to the left)5. The first part of your report might look like the following:

“`Country Population Area—————- ———- ———-Falkland Islands 3 4700French Guiana 290 32253Suriname 586 63252Uruguay 3475 68037Guyana 787 82978Ecuador 17705 106851. . . . . . . .“`

6. After all countries have been printed, show totals for the population and area columns.
